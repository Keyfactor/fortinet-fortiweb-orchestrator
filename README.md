> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the FortiWeb Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


* TestCases


## Create the FortiWeb Certificate Store Type

To use the FortiWeb Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the FortiWeb Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.



* **Create FortiWeb using kfutil**:

    ```shell
    # FortiWeb
    kfutil store-types create FortiWeb
    ```

* **Create FortiWeb manually in the Command UI**:
    <details><summary>Create FortiWeb manually in the Command UI</summary>

    Create a store type called `FortiWeb` with the attributes in the tables below:

    #### Basic Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Name | FortiWeb | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
    | Short Name | FortiWeb | Short display name for the store type |
    | Capability | FortiWeb | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
    | Supports Add | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
    | Supports Remove | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
    | Supports Discovery | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
    | Supports Reenrollment | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
    | Supports Create | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
    | Needs Server | âœ… Checked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
    | Blueprint Allowed | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
    | Uses PowerShell | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
    | Requires Store Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
    | Supports Entry Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

    The Basic tab should look like this:

    ![FortiWeb Basic Tab](docsource/images/FortiWeb-basic-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Advanced Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Supports Custom Alias | Required | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
    | Private Key Handling | Optional | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. Required because IIS certificates without private keys would be invalid. |
    | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

    The Advanced tab should look like this:

    ![FortiWeb Advanced Tab](docsource/images/FortiWeb-advanced-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Custom Fields Tab
    Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

    | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
    | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
    | ServerUsername | Server Username | A username for CLI/SSH and REST API access.  Used for inventory. (or valid PAM key if the username is stored in a KF Command configured PAM integration). | Secret |  | ðŸ”² Unchecked |
    | ServerPassword | Server Password | A password for CLI/SSH and REST API access.  Used for inventory.(or valid PAM key if the password is stored in a KF Command configured PAM integration). | Secret |  | ðŸ”² Unchecked |
    | ServerUseSsl | Use SSL | Should be true, http is not supported. | Bool | true | âœ… Checked |
    | ADom | Administrative Domain | Specifies the administrative or virtual domain within the FortiWeb system that the API user is targeting. | String | root | ðŸ”² Unchecked |

    The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

## Installation

1. **Download the latest FortiWeb Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.** 

    Navigate to the [FortiWeb Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/fortinet-fortiweb-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.
    | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `fortinet-fortiweb-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` | 
    | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the FortiWeb Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `fortinet-fortiweb-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `fortinet-fortiweb-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The FortiWeb Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplimented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).

### API Profile: `ApiProfile`

The `ApiProfile` is configured with the following permissions:

#### Access Control Permissions
The table below specifies the permissions granted to the API profile for each area of the FortiWeb system:

| **Access Control**                     | **Permissions**  |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Maintenance                            | None             |
| System Configuration                   | Read-Write       |
| Network Configuration                  | None             |
| Log & Report                           | None             |
| Auth Users                             | None             |
| Server Policy Configuration            | Read-Write       |
| Web Protection Configuration           | None             |
| Machine Learning Configuration         | None             |
| Web Anti-Defacement Management         | None             |
| Web Vulnerability Scan Configuration   | None             |

#### Description of Permissions
- **None**: No access to the specified area.
- **Read-Only**: The user can view configurations but cannot make changes.
- **Read-Write**: The user can view and modify configurations.

#### Key Permissions for Integration
1. **System Configuration**: Grants the orchestrator the ability to manage system settings required for certificate deployment and system integration.
2. **Server Policy Configuration**: Allows the orchestrator to manage server policies, ensuring secure and efficient traffic handling.

### Security Best Practices
- Limit the use of the `ApiProfile` to only the Keyfactor Orchestrator account.
- Regularly audit API profile usage and permissions to ensure alignment with the principle of least privilege.
- Enable logging for API activity to monitor orchestrator interactions with the FortiWeb system.

### Integration Checklist
1. Create the `ApiProfile` in the FortiWeb system with the permissions listed above.
2. Assign the profile to the user account that the Keyfactor Orchestrator will use for authentication.
3. Verify that the orchestrator can access and modify only the required areas (System Configuration and Server Policy Configuration).
4. Perform a functionality test to ensure the orchestrator can complete all necessary operations without encountering permission errors.

By following this configuration, the Keyfactor Orchestrator will have secure and functional access to integrate with the FortiWeb system effectively.

For additional guidance, consult the FortiWeb and Keyfactor documentation or reach out to your administrator.

### 1. **`username`**
- **Definition**: The username of the FortiWeb API account.
- **Purpose**: Identifies the specific user accessing the FortiWeb API.
- **Details**: This username should belong to a user account configured in FortiWeb with an associated API profile that has the necessary permissions for the integration.
- **Example**:
  ```admin```

---

### 2. **`password`**
- **Definition**: The password associated with the username for authentication.
- **Purpose**: Used to securely authenticate the API user and ensure access control.
- **Details**: Ensure the password is strong and stored securely (e.g., encrypted storage or environment variables).
- **Example**:
  ```P@ssw0rd123!```

---

### 3. **`vdom` (ADOM Name)**
- **Definition**: The **Administrative Domain (ADOM)** or **Virtual Domain (VDOM)** name in the FortiWeb system.
- **Purpose**: Specifies the administrative or virtual domain within the FortiWeb system that the API user is targeting.
  - **ADOMs (Administrative Domains)**: Used in FortiManager environments to manage multiple instances of FortiWeb. ADOMs isolate administrative control between teams or environments.
  - **VDOMs (Virtual Domains)**: Virtualization feature in FortiWeb to segment and isolate configurations or policies within a single appliance.
- **When Required**: If the FortiWeb appliance is configured with multiple ADOMs or VDOMs, this field directs the API user to the correct domain. If no ADOMs/VDOMs are configured, use `"root"`.
- **Example**:
  ```Production_ADOM```

---

### **Best Practices**

#### 1. **Username & Password Security**
- Use a dedicated API user account with minimal permissions.
- Store credentials securely using encrypted storage or environment variables.
- Regularly rotate passwords and follow your organization's security policies.

#### 2. **VDOM/ADOM Selection**
- Ensure the `vdom` value corresponds to the correct administrative or virtual domain in your FortiWeb system.
- For single-domain systems, use the default value: `"root"`.

#### 3. **Audit Access**
- Regularly review and audit API user activity to ensure security and compliance.
